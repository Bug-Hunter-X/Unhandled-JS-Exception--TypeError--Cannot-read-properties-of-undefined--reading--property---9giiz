This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This is a common error in React Native, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or data fetching.  For example, if you're trying to display data from an API call before the data has been fetched, you'll encounter this error.  Another common scenario is when you're working with navigation parameters and try to access a parameter that doesn't exist.
