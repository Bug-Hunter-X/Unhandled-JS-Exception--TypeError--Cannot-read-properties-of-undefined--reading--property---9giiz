This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug involving accessing properties of null or undefined objects and its solution. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation using optional chaining and nullish coalescing.  This example highlights best practices for handling potential null or undefined values to prevent runtime errors.
